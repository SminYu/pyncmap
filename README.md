# pyNCmap

Use NCL colortable in python matplotlib colormap without install new packages

All colortable in NCL exist in cmap_data.tar.gz (Ref: https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Graphics/color_table_gallery.shtml)

Unzip the compressed file and place on the same directory with the python code

No compatibility issue

You can use reversed colormap for any colortable just by typing "_r" after the colortable name (i.e., rainbow_r)
